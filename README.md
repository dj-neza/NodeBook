## NodeBook Student Interface

A progressive web application built with React to support the NodeBook platform for teachers (available [here](https://github.com/Ruxandra22/NodeBook)).

### What is NodeBook? 

NodeBook is a web platform focused on helping teachers detect bullying in the classroom using technology, sociometry and visualisation techniques. We make detecting the problem easier so the teacher can spend more time solving it. The teacher can send a task or a questionnaire to the students and as they respond, we analyse their answers to get a more psychological underline. Then we visually present this to the teacher, who can view class dynamics changes and progress and act upon them. 

### Student Interface

The aim of the student interface is to be very easy to use. The students use their login to get access to the tasks and can then answer different kinds of questions. They can see the tasks they have yet to complete and since it's a progressive web application, they can add it to their home screen and use as a mobile application or opt for the web version. That also makees it available on all kinds of smart phones simultaneouslty. 

### How To Try

The current version of the application is deployed [here](https://nodebook-legit.firebaseapp.com). It is very easy to use and you can test it out by registering directly in the application. However, to get access to the questionnaire, you have to be added to the class on the teacher platform and then create a questionnaire for that class.
